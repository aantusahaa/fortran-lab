# Fortran Programming Lab II (MTHL-3206)

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of numerical methods implemented in modern Fortran, which were learned during the course Fortran Programming Lab II (MTHL-3206). These methods are widely used in scientific computing, engineering simulations, and mathematical problem-solving. Each method is implemented in Fortran 90/95/2003/2008 style (modern Fortran).
